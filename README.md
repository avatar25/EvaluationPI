# EvaluationPI
Evaluates Pi values from various techniques

First technique:
4*(1-1/3+1/5-1/7+1/9......N) ,where N is number of iterations. The more iterations there are, the better estimation

Second technique:
f(x) = 4/(1+x*x) , very commonly used method. it is quick

Third technique:
Monte Carlo method , very commonly known method. 

Output:
